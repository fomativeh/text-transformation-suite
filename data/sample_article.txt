Recent developments in quantum computing have raised concerns about current encryption standards.
Researchers at MIT demonstrated a quantum algorithm that could break RSA-2048 encryption in just 8 hours using a theoretical quantum computer with 20 million qubits.
While such powerful quantum computers don't yet exist, the research highlights the urgent need for quantum-resistant cryptography.
Governments and major tech companies are now investing heavily in post-quantum cryptography standards, which are expected to be finalized by 2024.
However, the transition to these new algorithms may take decades due to compatibility requirements with existing systems and the need for extensive testing.
This timeline creates significant urgency for organizations to begin planning their cryptographic transition strategies, particularly for data that requires long-term confidentiality.
