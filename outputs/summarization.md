## Prompt Variation 1: Concise (2-3 sentences)
**Prompt:**
Please provide a concise summary of the following article in 2-3 sentences, focusing on the key findings:
[ARTICLE TEXT]

**Input Article:**
> Recent developments in quantum computing have raised concerns about current encryption standards.
Researchers at MIT demonstrated a quantum algorithm that could break RSA-2048 encryption in just 8 hours using a theoretical quantum computer with 20 million qubits.
While such powerful quantum computers don't yet exist, the research highlights the urgent need for quantum-resistant cryptography.
Governments and major tech companies are now investing heavily in post-quantum cryptography standards, which are expected to be finalized by 2024.
However, the transition to these new algorithms may take decades due to compatibility requirements with existing systems and the need for extensive testing.
This timeline creates significant urgency for organizations to begin planning their cryptographic transition strategies, particularly for data that requires long-term confidentiality.

**Output:**
> Quantum computing advances threaten current encryption standards. Researchers showed a quantum algorithm could break RSA-2048 encryption in 8 hours with a powerful enough quantum computer. This underscores the urgent need to develop quantum-resistant cryptography solutions.

**Output:**
> Breakthroughs in quantum computing research have significant implications for encryption security. Scientists have demonstrated that a theoretical quantum computer with 20 million qubits could break RSA-2048 encryption in just 8 hours using a specialized algorithm. Although quantum computers of this capability don't currently exist, the research signals a pressing need for quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions. In response, governments and technology companies are actively investing in and developing post-quantum cryptography standards. These new standards are expected to be finalized by 2024, but the transition may take decades due to the need for compatibility with existing systems and infrastructure.

This timeline creates significant urgency for organizations to begin planning their cryptographic transition strategies, particularly for data that requires long-term confidentiality.

**Output:**
> This article presents a compelling argument about the urgent threat quantum computing poses to current encryption, effectively highlighting the groundbreaking research from MIT demonstrating a theoretical break of RSA-2048. A key strength of its position is the clear timeline it establishes, noting both the 2024 expectation for new standards and the decades-long transition period, which creates a tangible call to action for organizations. However, the argument is limited by its reliance on a purely theoretical model—a 20-million-qubit machine—which represents a monumental engineering hurdle far beyond current capabilities. It also does not deeply address the significant economic and logistical costs of a global cryptographic transition, potentially underestimating the inertia of existing infrastructure. Ultimately, while the core warning is valid and well-supported, the practical timeline for the risk may be more extended than the urgency implied.
